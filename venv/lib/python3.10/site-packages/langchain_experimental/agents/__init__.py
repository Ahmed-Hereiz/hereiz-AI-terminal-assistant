"""**Agent** is a class that uses an LLM to choose 
a sequence of actions to take.

In Chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded. In Agents,
a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions
to take and in which order.

Agents select and use **Tools** and **Toolkits** for actions.
