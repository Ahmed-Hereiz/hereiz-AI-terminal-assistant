"""
**Causal program-aided language (CPAL)** is a concept implemented in LangChain as
a chain for causal modeling and narrative decomposition.

CPAL improves upon the program-aided language (**PAL**) by incorporating
causal structure to prevent hallucination in language models,
particularly when dealing with complex narratives and math
problems with nested dependencies.

CPAL involves translating causal narratives into a stack of operations,
setting hypothetical conditions for causal models, and decomposing
narratives into story elements.

It allows for the creation of causal chains that define the relationships
between different elements in a narrative, enabling the modeling and analysis
of causal relationships within a given context.
